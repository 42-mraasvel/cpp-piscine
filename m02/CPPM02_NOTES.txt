ADHOC POLYMORPHISM

		FUNCTION OVERLOADING


	Function having the same name, accepting different parameters

		- One function name
		- Different parameters for every overload



OPERATOR OVERLOADING


	VOCABULARY

		Infix:   1 + 1
		Prefix:  + 1 1
		Postfix: 1 1 +

		Prefix is also known as Functional rotation : f(x, y) or +(1, 1)
		Key to understanding overloading in C++

		1.+(1) : class method notation

	<return> operator<operator>(parameter) [const];

	Rules:

		1. Overload must be natural, if it seems strange, don't do it
		2. Overload must be related to the natural semantics of this operator
		3. Just don't do it, in a lot of cases it doesn't make sense to use operator overloading


		It makes sense to use in for example mathematical classes, or copy constructors

CANONICAL FORM

	Coplien form


	Way of building basic classes: every classes, good practice

		Constructor
		Destructor
		Copy Constructor
		Virtual Assignment Operator
