	Memory allocation, but it calls the constructors and destructors of objects, which malloc does not do

References:

	More like an alias for a variable
	Because it's const, it can't be changed so therefore there is on point in it being a value itself

	A pointer that is always constant
	Always dereferenced
	Never void

File Streams:

	input/output streams

	stringstreams

	ostringstream
	istringstream
